# React Notes and Concepts

## Day 1 (JSX, State)

- JSX, is called extension to JavaScript. Everything written inside JSX describes how our UI looks.
- React re-renders when state or props changed.
- State => holds data that's required for our component // integer, string, object. array, boolean.
- State changes UI after rendering.
- useState hook => used for holding data for our state.
- Always use prevValue with setter cos it's a async process and it might cause bug if we do in sync.
